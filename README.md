# Skin Lesion Classification using Deep Learning

## Introduction
Skin cancer is among the most prevalent forms of cancer worldwide. The timely detection and accurate classification of skin lesions can play a crucial role in improving the treatment outcomes. This project aims to employ deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for the automatic classification of skin lesions into benign and malignant categories based on dermoscopic images.

## Data Preprocessing
The initial step involves resizing and normalizing the images in the dataset. All images are resized to a standard size of 224x224 pixels to ensure uniformity. Additionally, the pixel values of the images are normalized to fall within the range of 0 and 1.

## Data Augmentation
To enhance the model's ability to generalize, various data augmentation techniques are applied to the training dataset. These techniques include rotation, width and height shifts, shear transformations, zooming, and horizontal flipping. This results in a more robust model that is capable of understanding various aspects of skin lesions.

## Model Building
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized for the task. The architecture comprises multiple layers, including convolutional layers for feature extraction, max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification. A dropout layer is also included to reduce overfitting.

## Model Training
The model is trained using a binary classification loss function and an optimization algorithm. A batch size is chosen for training the model, and the training process is carried out over a specified number of epochs. During this phase, the model learns to make accurate predictions on the training data.

## Model Evaluation
Post-training, the model's performance is assessed on a separate validation dataset that was not exposed to the model during the training phase. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy, loss, precision, and recall.

## Model Testing
The final step involves using the trained model to make predictions on new and unseen images. The model generates a score between 0 and 1, which is thresholded to classify the lesion as either benign or malignant.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the potential of using deep learning for the classification of skin lesions. The model built is capable of classifying skin lesions into benign and malignant categories with reasonable accuracy. This application has promising utility in aiding healthcare professionals for early diagnosis and treatment planning for skin cancer.
